- All the logic must always be written inside Systems. Systems model behaviours that can be applied to entities.
- Entities are not objects, they just aggregate Components (which is equivalent to implementing high-level interfaces)
- Components don’t hold logic, they are just data wrappers.
- Components can’t have methods, only get and set properties.
- Each System has one responsibility only.
- Systems cannot be injected.
- Systems communicate with each other through components.
- Systems can have injected dependencies, but this would mean mixing ECS with OOP.
- Systems do not know each other.
- Systems must be packed in different modules according to their level of abstraction.
